               <p>My name is Andrew Duong. I am a Vietnamese-American who was born in San Jose and graduated from San Jose State University with MIS major and CS minor. On my free time, I enjoy spending time alone along with my family and friends in creating fond memories! Having overall 7.5 years of experience in TaeKwonDo, I enjoy anything the requires the body to move! Fishing and coastal foraging along the Pacific coast is something I will never get tired of as well! Even though I graduated in MIS, I plan on becoming a web developer and hone my skills on the coding end after completing this UCB Coding Bootcamp!</p>
